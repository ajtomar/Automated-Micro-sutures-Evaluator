Micro-Suturing is a task of performing suturing (stitching) under a microscope in a medical field. It is an indis- pensable neurosurgical skill. Automated evaluation of micro-suturing would lead to efficient, fast and unbiased training of a trainee neurosurgeon. We propose to evaluate the effectiveness (final image) of micro-suturing using various parameters. In this assignment, you will calculate three parameters of the evaluation using the classical computer vision algorithms. Namely,
(a) Number of sutures
(b) Inter-suture distance
(c) Angulation of the suture
