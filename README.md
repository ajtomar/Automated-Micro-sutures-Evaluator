Micro-suturing is the task of performing suturing (stitching) under a microscope in the medical field. It is an indispensable neurosurgical skill. Automated evaluation of micro-suturing would lead to efficient, fast, and unbiased training of a trainee neurosurgeon. We propose to evaluate the effectiveness (final image) of micro-suturing using various parameters. In this assignment, you will calculate three parameters of the evaluation using classical computer vision algorithms. Namely,

(a) Number of sutures

(b) Inter-suture distance

(c) Angulation of the suture
